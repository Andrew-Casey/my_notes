# My DS Notes
This is a repository for my notes
Thus far we have learned that git is a version control program
The loop seems to be; create new data on local computer, save file to the local repository, compare to online version with 'git status', then proceed with 'git add' in preparation for upload. 
The next step would be to 'git commit' and add a comment with '-m' a description of the version. 
Then git push, pushes the new version to githubs repository.
